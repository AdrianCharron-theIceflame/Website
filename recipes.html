                <dd>
                    This is a fan-favourite of the Kingdom Hearts series. Ever since its first appearance in Kingdom
                    Hearts 2, this has been a sought-after recipe. Its “Salty, no… Sweat!” flavour, as Donald would say,
                    is iconic and if you want a different you want a different take on the recipe consider giving our
                    friends at the <a href="https://youtu.be/5fTd1aYzNHI?si=Y9ztjR8K6hbnAX7z" target="_blank">Babish

                <dt><a href="./recipes_not_found.html">Ultralisk Filet</a></dt>
                <dd>
                    Starcraft is an iconic game franchise known the world over. This alien race in particular is very
                    fleshy: The Zerg. If anyone can manage to kill one of these behemoth-sized Zerg, also called an
                    Ultralisk, has amazing cuts of meat associated with it. Well worth the risk, the filet is amazing!

                    It must be said that Gamer Foodz does not support the workplace culture that Activision Blizzard
                    King has cultivated throughout the years.

                <dt><a href="./recipes_not_found.html">Scrin Rings</a></dt>
                <dd>
                    These delectable little rings of golden batter and alien calamari are amazing! If you're going out
                    hunting for a Scrin Assimilator though, bring a de-cloaking device and watch out for ambushes since
                    they can't defend themselves. Sure, they may be Tiberium-based light forms, but for good food? Who
                    wouldn't want to risk death by Tiberium exposure?

                <dt><a href="./recipes_not_found.html">Spartan Salad</a></dt>
                <dd>
                    Do you think a Spartan God has gotten this big by eating only meat? Absolutely not! A Spartan God of
                    War knows that a balanced meal must include even salads! Gluten-free, lactose-free and
                    vegan-friendly as all salads in the Nordic and Greek countries should be!

                <dt><a href="./recipes_not_found.html">Aunt May's Pancakes</a></dt>
                <dd>
                    Aunt May's Pancakes took the internet by storm when Spider-Man 2018 came out and for good reason.
                    These are a healthy tasty version of your favourite household pancake recipe with a bonus blueberry
                    coulis. Aunt May would be proud!

                <dt><a href="./recipes_not_found.html">Mushroom Stew</a></dt>
                <dd>
                    Simple and flavourful! Multiple types of mushrooms and a full day of simmering in your oven will
                    yield an absolutely scrumptious and delightfully meat-free stew.

                <dd>
                    Ah, Toriel who wouldn't want to enjoy a slice of your cinnamon butterscotch pie? Enjoy the smooth
                    richness of the butterscotch mixed with the warming heat of the cinnamon. One can always tell when
                    this pie is baked with motherly love!

                <dd>
                    If you're the Ghost of Hallownest, you'll need to stay as healthy as you can at all times to keep
                    your Geo on you! Make a few of these Cocktails of Soul to share with you and your friends during a
                    night of partying. For those who don't want any Radiance in your cocktails, we have an alcohol-free

                <dt><a href="./recipes_not_found.html">Birthday Headshot Doughnuts</a></dt>
                <dd>
                    Created with special guests Nic and Felix from FAN Industries, each doughnut is shot through with a
                    precision rifle which causes an explosion of fine edible glitter in the studio to decorate our
                    lovely treats. Enjoy the feeling of being as precise as some of the best soldiers in the year 2552!
