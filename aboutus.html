            <h4>Creator: <span>Adrian Charron</span></h4>
            <p>Adrian Created this website for his love of gaming and food. His father didn't start off as the best chef
                in
                the world, for a young Adrian, but improved to the point where his son would consider him a great home
                chef.<br>His father is also the one to have introduced Adrian to gaming. From a young age, Adrian
                Charron
                would play educational games like “Plumo at the Zoo”. He was then shown how to play games like “Age of
                Empires”, “Starcraft”, and “Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun”.<br>These two loves blossomed into this
                website.
