                <h4>I have [insert food restriction here]. Do you have any alternatives?</h4>
                <p>
                    We at Gamer Foodz understand the diversity of our fan base as well as the diversity of any game's
                    fan base. To be as inclusive as possible, we've chosen our recipes and ingredients to contain the
                    least amount of allergens as possible. We also include local alternatives or alternative recipes
                    where we can. If you cannot use a recipe at all, we also include suggestions for other recipes based
                    on the game franchise and food style.

                <h4>When are recipes added?</h4>
                <p>
                    Recipes are added over time as we partner up with more and more games. As we get more visitors to
                    our website and more purchases of books and merch we increase our reputation in the eyes of major
                    video-game publishers and minor indie developer studios. Then, our Head Chef and Studio Relations
                    work tirelessly with those companies until a foolproof recipe is devised!
